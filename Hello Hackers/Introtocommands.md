#Intro To Commands

In this challenge, you will invoke your first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:

```sh
hacker@dojo:~$ whoami  
hacker
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.

## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs to type ```hello```, which prints the flag

#### Commands run: 

```sh
$ hello
```

## Flag: 

```

```

### Notes:
commands in Linux are case sensitive.
