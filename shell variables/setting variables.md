# Setting variables
To solve this level, you must set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. 

## Solution
Set PWN=COLLEGE to get the flag.

```sh
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{IoaPbm7IAqZSUb5KPN8PFe5HxiD.QX5UTN0wCM0AzNzEzW}
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{IoaPbm7IAqZSUb5KPN8PFe5HxiD.QX5UTN0wCM0AzNzEzW}
```
