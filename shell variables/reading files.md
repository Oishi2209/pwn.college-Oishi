# Reading files
use that to read /challenge/read_me into the PWN environment variable, and we'll give you the flag! The /challenge/read_me will keep changing, so you'll need to read it right into the PWN variable with one command!

## Solution
Used read PWN < /challenge/read_me to print the flag.

```sh
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{wClJohWGR_tCrGwghEnOUyXeYO9.QXwIDO0wCM0AzNzEzW}
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{wClJohWGR_tCrGwghEnOUyXeYO9.QXwIDO0wCM0AzNzEzW}
```
