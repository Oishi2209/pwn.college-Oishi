# Cat command
In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the flag file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with cat

## Solution
The challenge says to use cat to read the flag from the home directory so I simply used the cat flag.

```sh
Connected!
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{MkwZXapzMKIgj_3gunYK-0n4_2k.QXxcTN0wCM0AzNzEzW}
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{MkwZXapzMKIgj_3gunYK-0n4_2k.QXxcTN0wCM0AzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:
cat is most often used for reading out files. cat will concatenate (hence the name) multiple files if provided multiple arguments.
