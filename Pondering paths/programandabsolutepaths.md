# Program and absolute paths

This challenge again requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path. You'll want to execute the run file that is in the challenge directory that is, in turn, in the / directory. he name of the challenge program in this level is run, and it lives in the /challenge directory. Thus, the path to the run challenge program is /challenge/run.

## Solution:

The run file is in the challenge directory. Every file system starts with '/'. Thus, the solution is /challenge/run.
```sh
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IBLp5jMgwoT-y-e814VMSP5ni1c.QX1QTN0wCM0AzNzEzW}
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{IBLp5jMgwoT-y-e814VMSP5ni1c.QX1QTN0wCM0AzNzEzW}
```
